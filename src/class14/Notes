Methods/functions/behaviours:
    Method is block of code. When we call the method all the logic is executed that is present inside the method.
    Method can also take parameters which is the data that we can pass when we call these methods.
Why we should learn about methods:
    1) Code re-usability
    2) Organize the code
    3) Changing code becomes easier.
